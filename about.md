My name is <span style="color:green;">Jithesh Chandrasekharan</span>. I am passionate about programming and have been working as a Software Engineer for more than a decade now.
I love what I do and hope you find this blog useful.  

**JMedium** (Jithesh's medium) is a programming journal, where I documents my experiments/experience with technologies using at work or for fun during my part time .

My recent focus in on data and cloud technologies, so expect more posts on that topic.     

<!--My favorite form of communication is Twitter, where you'll find me ranting 140 characters at a time at <span><a href="https://twitter.com/gitjit"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></span>.
